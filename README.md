# HARP-I
HARP-I is a novel methodology based on the same principles that the [Harmonic Phase analysis (HARP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARP_(algorithm)) method.

HARP-I stands for Harmonic Phase Interpolation method and uses radial basis function interpolations to recover the tissue motion from tagged MR images.
