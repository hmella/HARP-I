% THINPLATE - Implements the Thin Plate Radial Basis Function (RBF)
%
% Description:
%   This class defines the Thin Plate RBF, a popular choice for scattered data 
%   interpolation due to its smoothness and ability to model higher-order deformations. 
%   The Thin Plate RBF is defined as:
%       Ï†(r) = r^2 * log(r), where r is the distance.
%
% Syntax:
%   obj = ThinPlate();        % Create an instance of the Thin Plate RBF class
%   v = obj.rbf(r, a);        % Evaluate the Thin Plate RBF
%
% Inputs:
%   r - Distance matrix or distances between points (scalar or array).
%   a - Unused parameter for compatibility with the abstract base class `rbfx`.
%
% Outputs:
%   v - RBF values evaluated at the given distances.
%
% Example:
%   % Create an instance of the Thin Plate RBF class
%   phi = ThinPlate();
%
%   % Define distances
%   r = linspace(0.1, 2, 100); % Distance matrix (avoiding r = 0 to prevent log(0))
%
%   % Evaluate the Thin Plate RBF
%   v = phi.rbf(r, []);
%
%   % Plot the RBF
%   plot(r, v);
%   xlabel('Distance (r)');
%   ylabel('RBF Value');
%   title('Thin Plate Radial Basis Function');
%
% Methods:
%   rbf(r, a)       - Computes the Thin Plate RBF values for a given distance matrix `r`.
%                     The parameter `a` is unused but retained for compatibility.
%   D1(r, a, x)     - Placeholder for the first derivative of the Thin Plate RBF 
%                     (returns an empty array).
%   D2(r, a, x)     - Placeholder for the second derivative of the Thin Plate RBF 
%                     (returns an empty array).
%   D3(r, a, x)     - Placeholder for the third derivative of the Thin Plate RBF 
%                     (returns an empty array).
%   D4(r, a, x)     - Placeholder for the fourth derivative of the Thin Plate RBF 
%                     (returns an empty array).
%   G(r, a, x, y)   - Placeholder for gradient-related calculations (returns an empty array).
%   L(r, a)         - Placeholder for Laplacian-related calculations (returns an empty array).
%   B(r, a, x, y)   - Placeholder for biharmonic operator calculations (returns an empty array).
%   D12(r, a, x, y) - Placeholder for mixed second-order derivatives (returns an empty array).
%   D22(r, a, x, y) - Placeholder for second-order derivatives in the second dimension 
%                     (returns an empty array).

%
% Notes:
%   - The Thin Plate RBF is suitable for interpolation tasks requiring smoothness 
%     and is particularly effective in 2D.
%   - The parameter `a` is included for compatibility but is not used in this implementation.
%   - Avoid `r = 0` to prevent undefined behavior due to the logarithm term log(r).
