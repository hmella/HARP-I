# HARP-I
HARP-I (Harmonic Phase Interpolation) is a method that utilizes radial basis function interpolation to recover tissue motion from 2D and 3D tagged MR images.

## Installing unwrapping functionalities
HARP-I relies on the unwrapping algorithm implemented in the **DENSEanalysis** toolbox. However, any unwrapping procedure can be used. The unwrapping algorithm is available in the [DENSEanalysis repository](https://github.com/denseanalysis/denseanalysis/tree/main).

To install **DENSEanalysis** and access its unwrapping functionalities, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/denseanalysis/denseanalysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the **DENSEanalysis** folder:
   ```sh
   cd denseanalysis/
   ```
3. Open **MATLAB** and run:
   ```matlab
   DENSEsetup
   ```

## HARP-I installation
To install **HARP-I**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:hmella/HARP-I.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the **HARP-I** folder:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/HARP-I
   ```
3. Open **MATLAB** and run:
   ```matlab
   HARPIsetup
   ```

### Graphical Installation Demonstration

For users who prefer a graphical interface instead of using the terminal, a step-by-step video tutorial is available here:

## Examples  
HARP-I includes demo scripts showcasing its application to **2D and 3D tagged MR images**. These can be found in the `examples/` folder.  

:file_folder: Inside this folder, you will also find a `README` file that provides additional explanations about the demo scripts and their usage.  

### Data Availability
Anonymized **2D and 3D tagged MR images** can be found in the `data/` directory.  

üì¢ **Note:** Due to size constraints, the data is hosted on an external cloud storage service. Please refer to the `README` within the `data/` folder for the download link.
